Unlike the traditional statistical machine translation, the neural machine\\ntranslation aims at building a single neural network that can be jointly tuned to\\nmaximize the translation performance. The models proposed recently for neu-\\nral machine translation often belong to a family of encoder–decoders and encode\\na source sentence into a ﬁxed-length vector from which a decoder generates a\\ntranslation. In this paper, we conjecture that the use of a ﬁxed-length vector is a\\nbottleneck in improving the performance of this basic encoder–decoder architec-\\nture, and propose to extend this by allowing a model to automatically (soft-)search\\nfor parts of a source sentence that are relevant to predicting a target word, without\\nhaving to form these parts as a hard segment explicitly. With this new approach,\\nwe achieve a translation performance comparable to the existing state-of-the-art\\nphrase-based system on the task of English-to-French translation. Furthermore,\\nqualitative analysis reveals that the (soft-)alignments found by the model agree\\nwell with our intuition.\\n1 I NTRODUCTION\\nNeural machine translation is a newly emerging approach to machine translation, recently proposed\\nby Kalchbrenner and Blunsom (2013), Sutskever et al. (2014) and Cho et al. (2014b). Unlike the\\ntraditional phrase-based translation system (see, e.g., Koehn et al., 2003) which consists of many\\nsmall sub-components that are tuned separately, neural machine translation attempts to build and\\ntrain a single, large neural network that reads a sentence and outputs a correct translation.\\nMost of the proposed neural machine translation models belong to a family of encoder–\\ndecoders (Sutskever et al., 2014; Cho et al., 2014a), with an encoder and a decoder for each lan-\\nguage, or involve a language-speciﬁc encoder applied to each sentence whose outputs are then com-\\npared (Hermann and Blunsom, 2014). An encoder neural network reads and encodes a source sen-\\ntence into a ﬁxed-length vector. A decoder then outputs a translation from the encoded vector. The\\nwhole encoder–decoder system, which consists of the encoder and the decoder for a language pair,\\nis jointly trained to maximize the probability of a correct translation given a source sentence.\\nA potential issue with this encoder–decoder approach is that a neural network needs to be able to\\ncompress all the necessary information of a source sentence into a ﬁxed-length vector. This may\\nmake it difﬁcult for the neural network to cope with long sentences, especially those that are longer\\nthan the sentences in the training corpus. Cho et al. (2014b) showed that indeed the performance of\\na basic encoder–decoder deteriorates rapidly as the length of an input sentence increases.\\nIn order to address this issue, we introduce an extension to the encoder–decoder model which learns\\nto align and translate jointly. Each time the proposed model generates a word in a translation, it\\n(soft-)searches for a set of positions in a source sentence where the most relevant information is\\nconcentrated. The model then predicts a target word based on the context vectors associated with\\nthese source positions and all the previous generated target words.\\n∗CIFAR Senior Fellow\\n1\\narXiv:1409.0473v7  [cs.CL]  19 May 2016'),\n",

Instead, it en-\\ncodes the input sentence into a sequence of vectors and chooses a subset of these vectors adaptively\\nwhile decoding the translation. This frees a neural translation model from having to squash all the\\ninformation of a source sentence, regardless of its length, into a ﬁxed-length vector. We show this\\nallows a model to cope better with long sentences.\\nIn this paper, we show that the proposed approach of jointly learning to align and translate achieves\\nsigniﬁcantly improved translation performance over the basic encoder–decoder approach. The im-\\nprovement is more apparent with longer sentences, but can be observed with sentences of any\\nlength. On the task of English-to-French translation, the proposed approach achieves, with a single\\nmodel, a translation performance comparable, or close, to the conventional phrase-based system.\\nFurthermore, qualitative analysis reveals that the proposed model ﬁnds a linguistically plausible\\n(soft-)alignment between a source sentence and the corresponding target sentence.\\n2 B ACKGROUND : N EURAL MACHINE TRANSLATION\\nFrom a probabilistic perspective, translation is equivalent to ﬁnding a target sentence y that max-\\nimizes the conditional probability of y given a source sentence x, i.e., arg maxy p(y | x). In\\nneural machine translation, we ﬁt a parameterized model to maximize the conditional probability\\nof sentence pairs using a parallel training corpus. Once the conditional distribution is learned by a\\ntranslation model, given a source sentence a corresponding translation can be generated by searching\\nfor the sentence that maximizes the conditional probability.\\nRecently, a number of papers have proposed the use of neural networks to directly learn this condi-\\ntional distribution (see, e.g., Kalchbrenner and Blunsom, 2013; Cho et al., 2014a; Sutskever et al.,\\n2014; Cho et al., 2014b; Forcada and ˜Neco, 1997). This neural machine translation approach typ-\\nically consists of two components, the ﬁrst of which encodes a source sentence x and the second\\ndecodes to a target sentence y. For instance, two recurrent neural networks (RNN) were used by\\n(Cho et al., 2014a) and (Sutskever et al., 2014) to encode a variable-length source sentence into a\\nﬁxed-length vector and to decode the vector into a variable-length target sentence.\\nDespite being a quite new approach, neural machine translation has already shown promising results.\\nSutskever et al. (2014) reported that the neural machine translation based on RNNs with long short-\\nterm memory (LSTM) units achieves close to the state-of-the-art performance of the conventional\\nphrase-based machine translation system on an English-to-French translation task. 1 Adding neural\\ncomponents to existing translation systems, for instance, to score the phrase pairs in the phrase\\ntable (Cho et al., 2014a) or to re-rank candidate translations (Sutskever et al., 2014), has allowed to\\nsurpass the previous state-of-the-art performance level.\\n2.1 RNN E NCODER –DECODER\\nHere, we describe brieﬂy the underlying framework, called RNN Encoder–Decoder, proposed by\\nCho et al. (2014a) and Sutskever et al. (2014) upon which we build a novel architecture that learns\\nto align and translate simultaneously.\\nIn the Encoder–Decoder framework, an encoder reads the input sentence, a sequence of vectors\\nx = (x1,··· ,xTx ), into a vector c.2 The most common approach is to use an RNN such that\\nht = f(xt,ht−1) (1)\\nand\\nc= q({h1,··· ,hTx }) ,\\nwhere ht ∈Rn is a hidden state at time t, and c is a vector generated from the sequence of the\\nhidden states. f and qare some nonlinear functions. Sutskever et al. (2014) used an LSTM as f and\\nq({h1,··· ,hT }) =hT , for instance.\\n1 We mean by the state-of-the-art performance, the performance of the conventional phrase-based system\\nwithout using any neural network-based component.\\n2 Although most of the previous works (see, e.g., Choet al., 2014a; Sutskeveret al., 2014; Kalchbrenner and\\nBlunsom, 2013) used to encode a variable-length input sentence into a ﬁxed-length vector, it is not necessary,\\nand even it may be beneﬁcial to have a variable-length vector, as we will show later.\\n2'),\n",

Instead, the alignment model directly com-\\nputes a soft alignment, which allows the gradient of the cost function to be backpropagated through.\\nThis gradient can be used to train the alignment model as well as the whole translation model jointly.\\nWe can understand the approach of taking a weighted sum of all the annotations as computing an\\nexpected annotation, where the expectation is over possible alignments. Letαij be a probability that\\nthe target word yi is aligned to, or translated from, a source word xj. Then, the i-th context vector\\nci is the expected annotation over all the annotations with probabilities αij.\\nThe probability αij, or its associated energy eij, reﬂects the importance of the annotation hj with\\nrespect to the previous hidden state si−1 in deciding the next state si and generating yi. Intuitively,\\nthis implements a mechanism of attention in the decoder. The decoder decides parts of the source\\nsentence to pay attention to. By letting the decoder have an attention mechanism, we relieve the\\nencoder from the burden of having to encode all information in the source sentence into a ﬁxed-\\nlength vector. With this new approach the information can be spread throughout the sequence of\\nannotations, which can be selectively retrieved by the decoder accordingly.\\n3.2 E NCODER : B IDIRECTIONAL RNN FOR ANNOTATING SEQUENCES\\nThe usual RNN, described in Eq. (1), reads an input sequence x in order starting from the ﬁrst\\nsymbol x1 to the last one xTx . However, in the proposed scheme, we would like the annotation\\nof each word to summarize not only the preceding words, but also the following words. Hence,\\nwe propose to use a bidirectional RNN (BiRNN, Schuster and Paliwal, 1997), which has been\\nsuccessfully used recently in speech recognition (see, e.g., Graves et al., 2013).\\nA BiRNN consists of forward and backward RNN’s. The forward RNN− →f reads the input sequence\\nas it is ordered (fromx1 to xTx ) and calculates a sequence offorward hidden states(− →h1,··· ,− →hTx ).\\nThe backward RNN ← −f reads the sequence in the reverse order (from xTx to x1), resulting in a\\nsequence of backward hidden states (← −h1,··· ,← −hTx ).\\nWe obtain an annotation for each word xj by concatenating the forward hidden state − →hj and the\\nbackward one ← −hj, i.e., hj =\\n[− →h⊤\\nj ; ← −h⊤\\nj\\n]⊤\\n. In this way, the annotation hj contains the summaries\\nof both the preceding words and the following words. Due to the tendency of RNNs to better\\nrepresent recent inputs, the annotation hj will be focused on the words around xj. This sequence\\nof annotations is used by the decoder and the alignment model later to compute the context vector\\n(Eqs. (5)–(6)).\\nSee Fig. 1 for the graphical illustration of the proposed model.\\n4 E XPERIMENT SETTINGS\\nWe evaluate the proposed approach on the task of English-to-French translation. We use the bilin-\\ngual, parallel corpora provided by ACL WMT ’14. 3 As a comparison, we also report the perfor-\\nmance of an RNN Encoder–Decoder which was proposed recently by Cho et al. (2014a).

The ﬁrst one is an RNN Encoder–Decoder (RNNencdec, Cho et al.,\\n2014a), and the other is the proposed model, to which we refer as RNNsearch. We train each model\\ntwice: ﬁrst with the sentences of length up to 30 words (RNNencdec-30, RNNsearch-30) and then\\nwith the sentences of length up to 50 word (RNNencdec-50, RNNsearch-50).\\nThe encoder and decoder of the RNNencdec have 1000 hidden units each. 7 The encoder of the\\nRNNsearch consists of forward and backward recurrent neural networks (RNN) each having 1000\\nhidden units. Its decoder has 1000 hidden units. In both cases, we use a multilayer network with a\\nsingle maxout (Goodfellow et al., 2013) hidden layer to compute the conditional probability of each\\ntarget word (Pascanu et al., 2014).\\nWe use a minibatch stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm together with Adadelta (Zeiler,\\n2012) to train each model. Each SGD update direction is computed using a minibatch of 80 sen-\\ntences. We trained each model for approximately 5 days.\\nOnce a model is trained, we use a beam search to ﬁnd a translation that approximately maximizes the\\nconditional probability (see, e.g., Graves, 2012; Boulanger-Lewandowski et al., 2013). Sutskever\\net al. (2014) used this approach to generate translations from their neural machine translation model.\\nFor more details on the architectures of the models and training procedure used in the experiments,\\nsee Appendices A and B.\\n5 R ESULTS\\n5.1 Q UANTITATIVE RESULTS\\nIn Table 1, we list the translation performances measured in BLEU score. It is clear from the table\\nthat in all the cases, the proposed RNNsearch outperforms the conventional RNNencdec. More\\nimportantly, the performance of the RNNsearch is as high as that of the conventional phrase-based\\ntranslation system (Moses), when only the sentences consisting of known words are considered.\\nThis is a signiﬁcant achievement, considering that Moses uses a separate monolingual corpus (418M\\nwords) in addition to the parallel corpora we used to train the RNNsearch and RNNencdec.\\n6 We used the tokenization script from the open-source machine translation package, Moses.\\n7 In this paper, by a ’hidden unit’, we always mean the gated hidden unit (see Appendix A.1.1).\\n5'),\n",

(◦) We disallowed the models to generate [UNK]\\ntokens when only the sentences having no unknown\\nwords were evaluated (last column).\\n5.2 Q UALITATIVE ANALYSIS\\n5.2.1 A LIGNMENT\\nThe proposed approach provides an intuitive way to inspect the (soft-)alignment between the words\\nin a generated translation and those in a source sentence. This is done by visualizing the annotation\\nweights αij from Eq. (6), as in Fig. 3. Each row of a matrix in each plot indicates the weights\\nassociated with the annotations. From this we see which positions in the source sentence were\\nconsidered more important when generating the target word.\\nWe can see from the alignments in Fig. 3 that the alignment of words between English and French\\nis largely monotonic. We see strong weights along the diagonal of each matrix. However, we also\\nobserve a number of non-trivial, non-monotonic alignments. Adjectives and nouns are typically\\nordered differently between French and English, and we see an example in Fig. 3 (a). From this\\nﬁgure, we see that the model correctly translates a phrase [European Economic Area] into [zone\\n´economique europ ´een]. The RNNsearch was able to correctly align [zone] with [Area], jumping\\nover the two words ([European] and [Economic]), and then looked one word back at a time to\\ncomplete the whole phrase [zone ´economique europ´eenne].\\nThe strength of the soft-alignment, opposed to a hard-alignment, is evident, for instance, from\\nFig. 3 (d). Consider the source phrase [the man] which was translated into [l’ homme]. Any hard\\nalignment will map [the] to [l’] and [man] to [homme]. This is not helpful for translation, as one\\nmust consider the word following [the] to determine whether it should be translated into [le], [la],\\n[les] or [l’]. Our soft-alignment solves this issue naturally by letting the model look at both [the] and\\n[man], and in this example, we see that the model was able to correctly translate [the] into [l’]. We\\nobserve similar behaviors in all the presented cases in Fig. 3. An additional beneﬁt of the soft align-\\nment is that it naturally deals with source and target phrases of different lengths, without requiring a\\ncounter-intuitive way of mapping some words to or from nowhere ([NULL]) (see, e.g., Chapters 4\\nand 5 of Koehn, 2010).\\n5.2.2 L ONG SENTENCES\\nAs clearly visible from Fig. 2 the proposed model (RNNsearch) is much better than the conventional\\nmodel (RNNencdec) at translating long sentences. This is likely due to the fact that the RNNsearch\\ndoes not require encoding a long sentence into a ﬁxed-length vector perfectly, but only accurately\\nencoding the parts of the input sentence that surround a particular word.\\nAs an example, consider this source sentence from the test set:\\nAn admitting privilege is the right of a doctor to admit a patient to a hospital or\\na medical centre to carry out a diagnosis or a procedure, based on his status as a\\nhealth care worker at a hospital.\\nThe RNNencdec-50 translated this sentence into:\\nUn privil `ege d’admission est le droit d’un m ´edecin de reconna ˆıtre un patient `a\\nl’hˆopital ou un centre m ´edical d’un diagnostic ou de prendre un diagnostic en\\nfonction de son ´etat de sant´e.\\n7'),\n",

After that\\npoint, the quality of the translation deteriorates, with basic mistakes such as the lack of a closing\\nquotation mark.\\nAgain, the RNNsearch-50 was able to translate this long sentence correctly:\\nCe genre d’exp´erience fait partie des efforts de Disney pour ”prolonger la dur ´ee\\nde vie de ses s ´eries et cr ´eer de nouvelles relations avec des publics via des\\nplateformes num´eriques de plus en plus importantes”, a-t-il ajout´e.\\nIn conjunction with the quantitative results presented already, these qualitative observations con-\\nﬁrm our hypotheses that the RNNsearch architecture enables far more reliable translation of long\\nsentences than the standard RNNencdec model.\\nIn Appendix C, we provide a few more sample translations of long source sentences generated by\\nthe RNNencdec-50, RNNsearch-50 and Google Translate along with the reference translations.\\n6 R ELATED WORK\\n6.1 L EARNING TO ALIGN\\nA similar approach of aligning an output symbol with an input symbol was proposed recently by\\nGraves (2013) in the context of handwriting synthesis. Handwriting synthesis is a task where the\\nmodel is asked to generate handwriting of a given sequence of characters. In his work, he used a\\nmixture of Gaussian kernels to compute the weights of the annotations, where the location, width\\nand mixture coefﬁcient of each kernel was predicted from an alignment model. More speciﬁcally,\\nhis alignment was restricted to predict the location such that the location increases monotonically.\\nThe main difference from our approach is that, in (Graves, 2013), the modes of the weights of the\\nannotations only move in one direction. In the context of machine translation, this is a severe limi-\\ntation, as (long-distance) reordering is often needed to generate a grammatically correct translation\\n(for instance, English-to-German).\\nOur approach, on the other hand, requires computing the annotation weight of every word in the\\nsource sentence for each word in the translation. This drawback is not severe with the task of\\ntranslation in which most of input and output sentences are only 15–40 words. However, this may\\nlimit the applicability of the proposed scheme to other tasks.\\n8'),\n",

(2003) introduced a neural probabilistic language model which uses a neural net-\\nwork to model the conditional probability of a word given a ﬁxed number of the preceding words,\\nneural networks have widely been used in machine translation. However, the role of neural net-\\nworks has been largely limited to simply providing a single feature to an existing statistical machine\\ntranslation system or to re-rank a list of candidate translations provided by an existing system.\\nFor instance, Schwenk (2012) proposed using a feedforward neural network to compute the score of\\na pair of source and target phrases and to use the score as an additional feature in the phrase-based\\nstatistical machine translation system. More recently, Kalchbrenner and Blunsom (2013) and Devlin\\net al. (2014) reported the successful use of the neural networks as a sub-component of the existing\\ntranslation system. Traditionally, a neural network trained as a target-side language model has been\\nused to rescore or rerank a list of candidate translations (see, e.g., Schwenk et al., 2006).\\nAlthough the above approaches were shown to improve the translation performance over the state-\\nof-the-art machine translation systems, we are more interested in a more ambitious objective of\\ndesigning a completely new translation system based on neural networks. The neural machine trans-\\nlation approach we consider in this paper is therefore a radical departure from these earlier works.\\nRather than using a neural network as a part of the existing system, our model works on its own and\\ngenerates a translation from a source sentence directly.\\n7 C ONCLUSION\\nThe conventional approach to neural machine translation, called an encoder–decoder approach, en-\\ncodes a whole input sentence into a ﬁxed-length vector from which a translation will be decoded.\\nWe conjectured that the use of a ﬁxed-length context vector is problematic for translating long sen-\\ntences, based on a recent empirical study reported by Cho et al. (2014b) and Pouget-Abadie et al.\\n(2014).\\nIn this paper, we proposed a novel architecture that addresses this issue. We extended the basic\\nencoder–decoder by letting a model (soft-)search for a set of input words, or their annotations com-\\nputed by an encoder, when generating each target word. This frees the model from having to encode\\na whole source sentence into a ﬁxed-length vector, and also lets the model focus only on information\\nrelevant to the generation of the next target word. This has a major positive impact on the ability\\nof the neural machine translation system to yield good results on longer sentences. Unlike with\\nthe traditional machine translation systems, all of the pieces of the translation system, including\\nthe alignment mechanism, are jointly trained towards a better log-probability of producing correct\\ntranslations.\\nWe tested the proposed model, called RNNsearch, on the task of English-to-French translation. The\\nexperiment revealed that the proposed RNNsearch outperforms the conventional encoder–decoder\\nmodel (RNNencdec) signiﬁcantly, regardless of the sentence length and that it is much more ro-\\nbust to the length of a source sentence. From the qualitative analysis where we investigated the\\n(soft-)alignment generated by the RNNsearch, we were able to conclude that the model can cor-\\nrectly align each target word with the relevant words, or their annotations, in the source sentence as\\nit generated a correct translation.\\nPerhaps more importantly, the proposed approach achieved a translation performance comparable to\\nthe existing phrase-based statistical machine translation. It is a striking result, considering that the\\nproposed architecture, or the whole family of neural machine translation, has only been proposed\\nas recently as this year. We believe the architecture proposed here is a promising step toward better\\nmachine translation and a better understanding of natural languages in general.\\nOne of challenges left for the future is to better handle unknown, or rare words. This will be required\\nfor the model to be more widely used and to match the performance of current state-of-the-art\\nmachine translation systems in all contexts.\\n9'),\n",

Here, we\\ndescribe the choices we made for the experiments in this paper.\\nA.1.1 R ECURRENT NEURAL NETWORK\\nFor the activation function f of an RNN, we use the gated hidden unit recently proposed by Cho\\net al. (2014a). The gated hidden unit is an alternative to the conventional simple units such as an\\nelement-wise tanh. This gated unit is similar to a long short-term memory (LSTM) unit proposed\\nearlier by Hochreiter and Schmidhuber (1997), sharing with it the ability to better model and learn\\nlong-term dependencies. This is made possible by having computation paths in the unfolded RNN\\nfor which the product of derivatives is close to 1. These paths allow gradients to ﬂow backward\\neasily without suffering too much from the vanishing effect (Hochreiter, 1991; Bengio et al., 1994;\\nPascanu et al., 2013a). It is therefore possible to use LSTM units instead of the gated hidden unit\\ndescribed here, as was done in a similar context by Sutskever et al. (2014).\\nThe new state si of the RNN employing ngated hidden units8 is computed by\\nsi = f(si−1,yi−1,ci) = (1−zi) ◦si−1 + zi ◦˜si,\\nwhere ◦is an element-wise multiplication, and zi is the output of the update gates (see below). The\\nproposed updated state ˜si is computed by\\n˜si = tanh (We(yi−1) +U[ri ◦si−1] +Cci) ,\\nwhere e(yi−1) ∈Rm is an m-dimensional embedding of a word yi−1, and ri is the output of the\\nreset gates (see below). When yi is represented as a 1-of-K vector, e(yi) is simply a column of an\\nembedding matrix E ∈Rm×K. Whenever possible, we omit bias terms to make the equations less\\ncluttered.\\nThe update gates zi allow each hidden unit to maintain its previous activation, and the reset gatesri\\ncontrol how much and what information from the previous state should be reset. We compute them\\nby\\nzi = σ(Wze(yi−1) +Uzsi−1 + Czci) ,\\nri = σ(Wre(yi−1) +Ursi−1 + Crci) ,\\nwhere σ(·) is a logistic sigmoid function.\\nAt each step of the decoder, we compute the output probability (Eq. (4)) as a multi-layered func-\\ntion (Pascanu et al., 2014). We use a single hidden layer of maxout units (Goodfellow et al., 2013)\\nand normalize the output probabilities (one for each word) with a softmax function (see Eq. (6)).\\nA.1.2 A LIGNMENT MODEL\\nThe alignment model should be designed considering that the model needs to be evaluated Tx ×Ty\\ntimes for each sentence pair of lengths Tx and Ty. In order to reduce computation, we use a single-\\nlayer multilayer perceptron such that\\na(si−1,hj) =v⊤\\na tanh (Wasi−1 + Uahj) ,\\nwhere Wa ∈Rn×n,Ua ∈Rn×2n and va ∈Rn are the weight matrices. Since Uahj does not\\ndepend on i, we can pre-compute it in advance to minimize the computational cost.\\n8 Here, we show the formula of the decoder. The same formula can be used in the encoder by simply\\nignoring the context vector ci and the related terms.\\n12'),\n",

Several proof-of-concepts demos, such as AutoGPT, GPT-Engineer and BabyAGI, serve as inspiring examples. The potentiality of LLM extends beyond generating well-written copies, stories, essays and programs; it can be framed as a powerful general problem solver.\\nAgent System Overview#\\nIn a LLM-powered autonomous agent system, LLM functions as the agent’s brain, complemented by several key components:\\n\\nPlanning\\n\\nSubgoal and decomposition: The agent breaks down large tasks into smaller, manageable subgoals, enabling efficient handling of complex tasks.\\nReflection and refinement: The agent can do self-criticism and self-reflection over past actions, learn from mistakes and refine them for future steps, thereby improving the quality of final results.\\n\\n\\nMemory\\n\\nShort-term memory: I would consider all the in-context learning (See Prompt Engineering) as utilizing short-term memory of the model to learn.\\nLong-term memory: This provides the agent with the capability to retain and recall (infinite) information over extended periods, often by leveraging an external vector store and fast retrieval.\\n\\n\\nTool use\\n\\nThe agent learns to call external APIs for extra information that is missing from the model weights (often hard to change after pre-training), including current information, code execution capability, access to proprietary information sources and more.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFig. 1. Overview of a LLM-powered autonomous agent system.\\nComponent One: Planning#\\nA complicated task usually involves many steps. An agent needs to know what they are and plan ahead.\\nTask Decomposition#\\nChain of thought (CoT; Wei et al. 2022) has become a standard prompting technique for enhancing model performance on complex tasks. The model is instructed to “think step by step” to utilize more test-time computation to decompose hard tasks into smaller and simpler steps. CoT transforms big tasks into multiple manageable tasks and shed lights into an interpretation of the model’s thinking process.\\nTree of Thoughts (Yao et al. 2023) extends CoT by exploring multiple reasoning possibilities at each step. It first decomposes the problem into multiple thought steps and generates multiple thoughts per step, creating a tree structure. The search process can be BFS (breadth-first search) or DFS (depth-first search) with each state evaluated by a classifier (via a prompt) or majority vote.\\nTask decomposition can be done (1) by LLM with simple prompting like \"Steps for XYZ.\\\\n1.\", \"What are the subgoals for achieving XYZ?\", (2) by using task-specific instructions; e.g. \"Write a story outline.\" for writing a novel, or (3) with human inputs.\\nAnother quite distinct approach, LLM+P (Liu et al. 2023), involves relying on an external classical planner to do long-horizon planning. This approach utilizes the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) as an intermediate interface to describe the planning problem. In this process, LLM (1) translates the problem into “Problem PDDL”, then (2) requests a classical planner to generate a PDDL plan based on an existing “Domain PDDL”, and finally (3) translates the PDDL plan back into natural language. Essentially, the planning step is outsourced to an external tool, assuming the availability of domain-specific PDDL and a suitable planner which is common in certain robotic setups but not in many other domains.\\nSelf-Reflection#\\nSelf-reflection is a vital aspect that allows autonomous agents to improve iteratively by refining past action decisions and correcting previous mistakes. It plays a crucial role in real-world tasks where trial and error are inevitable.\\nReAct (Yao et al. 2023) integrates reasoning and acting within LLM by extending the action space to be a combination of task-specific discrete actions and the language space. The former enables LLM to interact with the environment (e.g. use Wikipedia search API), while the latter prompting LLM to generate reasoning traces in natural language.\\nThe ReAct prompt template incorporates explicit steps for LLM to think, roughly formatted as:\\nThought: ...\\nAction: ...\\nObservation: ...\\n... (Repeated many times)\\n\\nFig. 2.  Examples of reasoning trajectories for knowledge-intensive tasks (e.g. HotpotQA, FEVER) and decision-making tasks (e.g. AlfWorld Env, WebShop). (Image source: Yao et al. 2023).\\nIn both experiments on knowledge-intensive tasks and decision-making tasks, ReAct works better than the Act-only baseline where Thought: … step is removed.\\nReflexion (Shinn & Labash 2023) is a framework to equip agents with dynamic memory and self-reflection capabilities to improve reasoning skills. Reflexion has a standard RL setup, in which the reward model provides a simple binary reward and the action space follows the setup in ReAct where the task-specific action space is augmented with language to enable complex reasoning steps. After each action $a_t$, the agent computes a heuristic $h_t$ and optionally may decide to reset the environment to start a new trial depending on the self-reflection results.\\n\\nFig. 3. Illustration of the Reflexion framework. (Image source: Shinn & Labash, 2023)\\nThe heuristic function determines when the trajectory is inefficient or contains hallucination and should be stopped. Inefficient planning refers to trajectories that take too long without success. Hallucination is defined as encountering a sequence of consecutive identical actions that lead to the same observation in the environment.\\nSelf-reflection is created by showing two-shot examples to LLM and each example is a pair of (failed trajectory, ideal reflection for guiding future changes in the plan). Then reflections are added into the agent’s working memory, up to three, to be used as context for querying LLM.\\n\\nFig. 4. Experiments on AlfWorld Env and HotpotQA. Hallucination is a more common failure than inefficient planning in AlfWorld. (Image source: Shinn & Labash, 2023)\\nChain of Hindsight (CoH; Liu et al. 2023) encourages the model to improve on its own outputs by explicitly presenting it with a sequence of past outputs, each annotated with feedback. Human feedback data is a collection of $D_h = \\\\{(x, y_i , r_i , z_i)\\\\}_{i=1}^n$, where $x$ is the prompt, each $y_i$ is a model completion, $r_i$ is the human rating of $y_i$, and $z_i$ is the corresponding human-provided hindsight feedback. Assume the feedback tuples are ranked by reward, $r_n \\\\geq r_{n-1} \\\\geq \\\\dots \\\\geq r_1$ The process is supervised fine-tuning where the data is a sequence in the form of $\\\\tau_h = (x, z_i, y_i, z_j, y_j, \\\\dots, z_n, y_n)$, where $\\\\leq i \\\\leq j \\\\leq n$. The model is finetuned to only predict $y_n$ where conditioned on the sequence prefix, such that the model can self-reflect to produce better output based on the feedback sequence. The model can optionally receive multiple rounds of instructions with human annotators at test time.\\nTo avoid overfitting, CoH adds a regularization term to maximize the log-likelihood of the pre-training dataset. To avoid shortcutting and copying (because there are many common words in feedback sequences), they randomly mask 0% - 5% of past tokens during training.\\nThe training dataset in their experiments is a combination of WebGPT comparisons, summarization from human feedback and human preference dataset.\\n\\nFig. 5. After fine-tuning with CoH, the model can follow instructions to produce outputs with incremental improvement in a sequence. (Image source: Liu et al. 2023)\\nThe idea of CoH is to present a history of sequentially improved outputs  in context and train the model to take on the trend to produce better outputs. Algorithm Distillation (AD; Laskin et al. 2023) applies the same idea to cross-episode trajectories in reinforcement learning tasks, where an algorithm is encapsulated in a long history-conditioned policy. Considering that an agent interacts with the environment many times and in each episode the agent gets a little better, AD concatenates this learning history and feeds that into the model. Hence we should expect the next predicted action to lead to better performance than previous trials. The goal is to learn the process of RL instead of training a task-specific policy itself.\\n\\nFig. 6. Illustration of how Algorithm Distillation (AD) works. (Image source: Laskin et al. 2023).\\nThe paper hypothesizes that any algorithm that generates a set of learning histories can be distilled into a neural network by performing behavioral cloning over actions. The history data is generated by a set of source policies, each trained for a specific task. At the training stage, during each RL run, a random task is sampled and a subsequence of multi-episode history is used for training, such that the learned policy is task-agnostic.\\nIn reality, the model has limited context window length, so episodes should be short enough to construct multi-episode history. Multi-episodic contexts of 2-4 episodes are necessary to learn a near-optimal in-context RL algorithm. The emergence of in-context RL requires long enough context.\\nIn comparison with three baselines, including ED (expert distillation, behavior cloning with expert trajectories instead of learning history), source policy (used for generating trajectories for distillation by UCB), RL^2 (Duan et al. 2017; used as upper bound since it needs online RL), AD demonstrates in-context RL with performance getting close to RL^2 despite only using offline RL and learns much faster than other baselines. When conditioned on partial training history of the source policy, AD also improves much faster than ED baseline.\\n\\nFig. 7. Comparison of AD, ED, source policy and RL^2 on environments that require memory and exploration. Only binary reward is assigned. The source policies are trained with A3C for \"dark\" environments and DQN for watermaze.(Image source: Laskin et al. 2023)\\nComponent Two: Memory#\\n(Big thank you to ChatGPT for helping me draft this section. I’ve learned a lot about the human brain and data structure for fast MIPS in my conversations with ChatGPT.)\\nTypes of Memory#\\nMemory can be defined as the processes used to acquire, store, retain, and later retrieve information. There are several types of memory in human brains.\\n\\n\\nSensory Memory: This is the earliest stage of memory, providing the ability to retain impressions of sensory information (visual, auditory, etc) after the original stimuli have ended. Sensory memory typically only lasts for up to a few seconds. Subcategories include iconic memory (visual), echoic memory (auditory), and haptic memory (touch).\\n\\n\\nShort-Term Memory (STM) or Working Memory: It stores information that we are currently aware of and needed to carry out complex cognitive tasks such as learning and reasoning. Short-term memory is believed to have the capacity of about 7 items (Miller 1956) and lasts for 20-30 seconds.\\n\\n\\nLong-Term Memory (LTM): Long-term memory can store information for a remarkably long time, ranging from a few days to decades, with an essentially unlimited storage capacity. There are two subtypes of LTM:\\n\\nExplicit / declarative memory: This is memory of facts and events, and refers to those memories that can be consciously recalled, including episodic memory (events and experiences) and semantic memory (facts and concepts).\\nImplicit / procedural memory: This type of memory is unconscious and involves skills and routines that are performed automatically, like riding a bike or typing on a keyboard.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFig. 8. Categorization of human memory.\\nWe can roughly consider the following mappings:\\n\\nSensory memory as learning embedding representations for raw inputs, including text, image or other modalities;\\nShort-term memory as in-context learning. It is short and finite, as it is restricted by the finite context window length of Transformer.\\nLong-term memory as the external vector store that the agent can attend to at query time, accessible via fast retrieval.\\n\\nMaximum Inner Product Search (MIPS)#\\nThe external memory can alleviate the restriction of finite attention span.  A standard practice is to save the embedding representation of information into a vector store database that can support fast maximum inner-product search (MIPS). To optimize the retrieval speed, the common choice is the approximate nearest neighbors (ANN)\\u200b algorithm to return approximately top k nearest neighbors to trade off a little accuracy lost for a huge speedup.\\nA couple common choices of ANN algorithms for fast MIPS:\\n\\nLSH (Locality-Sensitive Hashing): It introduces a hashing function such that similar input items are mapped to the same buckets with high probability, where the number of buckets is much smaller than the number of inputs.\\nANNOY (Approximate Nearest Neighbors Oh Yeah): The core data structure are random projection trees, a set of binary trees where each non-leaf node represents a hyperplane splitting the input space into half and each leaf stores one data point. Trees are built independently and at random, so to some extent, it mimics a hashing function. ANNOY search happens in all the trees to iteratively search through the half that is closest to the query and then aggregates the results. The idea is quite related to KD tree but a lot more scalable.\\nHNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World): It is inspired by the idea of small world networks where most nodes can be reached by any other nodes within a small number of steps; e.g. “six degrees of separation” feature of social networks. HNSW builds hierarchical layers of these small-world graphs, where the bottom layers contain the actual data points. The layers in the middle create shortcuts to speed up search. When performing a search, HNSW starts from a random node in the top layer and navigates towards the target. When it can’t get any closer, it moves down to the next layer, until it reaches the bottom layer. Each move in the upper layers can potentially cover a large distance in the data space, and each move in the lower layers refines the search quality.\\nFAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search): It operates on the assumption that in high dimensional space, distances between nodes follow a Gaussian distribution and thus there should exist clustering of data points. FAISS applies vector quantization by partitioning the vector space into clusters and then refining the quantization within clusters. Search first looks for cluster candidates with coarse quantization and then further looks into each cluster with finer quantization.\\nScaNN (Scalable Nearest Neighbors): The main innovation in ScaNN is anisotropic vector quantization. It quantizes a data point $x_i$ to $\\\\tilde{x}_i$ such that the inner product $\\\\langle q, x_i \\\\rangle$ is as similar to the original distance of $\\\\angle q, \\\\tilde{x}_i$ as possible, instead of picking the closet quantization centroid points.\\n\\n\\nFig. 9. Comparison of MIPS algorithms, measured in recall@10. (Image source: Google Blog, 2020)\\nCheck more MIPS algorithms and performance comparison in ann-benchmarks.com.\\nComponent Three: Tool Use#\\nTool use is a remarkable and distinguishing characteristic of human beings. We create, modify and utilize external objects to do things that go beyond our physical and cognitive limits. Equipping LLMs with external tools can significantly extend the model capabilities.\\n\\nFig. 10. A picture of a sea otter using rock to crack open a seashell, while floating in the water. While some other animals can use tools, the complexity is not comparable with humans. (Image source: Animals using tools)\\nMRKL (Karpas et al. 2022), short for “Modular Reasoning, Knowledge and Language”, is a neuro-symbolic architecture for autonomous agents. A MRKL system is proposed to contain a collection of “expert” modules and the general-purpose LLM works as a router to route inquiries to the best suitable expert module. These modules can be neural (e.g. deep learning models) or symbolic (e.g. math calculator, currency converter, weather API).\\nThey did an experiment on fine-tuning LLM to call a calculator, using arithmetic as a test case. Their experiments showed that it was harder to solve verbal math problems than explicitly stated math problems because LLMs (7B Jurassic1-large model) failed to extract the right arguments for the basic arithmetic reliably. The results highlight when the external symbolic tools can work reliably, knowing when to and how to use the tools are crucial, determined by the LLM capability.\\nBoth TALM (Tool Augmented Language Models; Parisi et al. 2022) and Toolformer (Schick et al. 2023) fine-tune a LM to learn to use external tool APIs. The dataset is expanded based on whether a newly added API call annotation can improve the quality of model outputs. See more details in the “External APIs” section of Prompt Engineering.\\nChatGPT Plugins and OpenAI API  function calling are good examples of LLMs augmented with tool use capability working in practice. The collection of tool APIs can be provided by other developers (as in Plugins) or self-defined (as in function calls).\\nHuggingGPT (Shen et al. 2023) is a framework to use ChatGPT as the task planner to select models available in HuggingFace platform according to the model descriptions and summarize the response based on the execution results.\\n\\nFig. 11. Illustration of how HuggingGPT works. (Image source: Shen et al. 2023)\\nThe system comprises of 4 stages:\\n(1) Task planning: LLM works as the brain and parses the user requests into multiple tasks. There are four attributes associated with each task: task type, ID, dependencies, and arguments. They use few-shot examples to guide LLM to do task parsing and planning.\\nInstruction:\\n\\nThe AI assistant can parse user input to several tasks: [{\"task\": task, \"id\", task_id, \"dep\": dependency_task_ids, \"args\": {\"text\": text, \"image\": URL, \"audio\": URL, \"video\": URL}}]. The \"dep\" field denotes the id of the previous task which generates a new resource that the current task relies on. A special tag \"-task_id\" refers to the generated text image, audio and video in the dependency task with id as task_id. The task MUST be selected from the following options: {{ Available Task List }}. There is a logical relationship between tasks, please note their order. If the user input can\\'t be parsed, you need to reply empty JSON. Here are several cases for your reference: {{ Demonstrations }}. The chat history is recorded as {{ Chat History }}. From this chat history, you can find the path of the user-mentioned resources for your task planning.\\n\\n(2) Model selection: LLM distributes the tasks to expert models, where the request is framed as a multiple-choice question. LLM is presented with a list of models to choose from. Due to the limited context length, task type based filtration is needed.\\nInstruction:\\n\\nGiven the user request and the call command, the AI assistant helps the user to select a suitable model from a list of models to process the user request. The AI assistant merely outputs the model id of the most appropriate model. The output must be in a strict JSON format: \"id\": \"id\", \"reason\": \"your detail reason for the choice\". We have a list of models for you to choose from {{ Candidate Models }}. Please select one model from the list.\\n\\n(3) Task execution: Expert models execute on the specific tasks and log results.\\nInstruction:\\n\\nWith the input and the inference results, the AI assistant needs to describe the process and results. The previous stages can be formed as - User Input: {{ User Input }}, Task Planning: {{ Tasks }}, Model Selection: {{ Model Assignment }}, Task Execution: {{ Predictions }}. You must first answer the user\\'s request in a straightforward manner. Then describe the task process and show your analysis and model inference results to the user in the first person. If inference results contain a file path, must tell the user the complete file path.\\n\\n(4) Response generation: LLM receives the execution results and provides summarized results to users.\\nTo put HuggingGPT into real world usage, a couple challenges need to solve: (1) Efficiency improvement is needed as both LLM inference rounds and interactions with other models slow down the process; (2) It relies on a long context window to communicate over complicated task content; (3) Stability improvement of LLM outputs and external model services.\\nAPI-Bank (Li et al. 2023) is a benchmark for evaluating the performance of tool-augmented LLMs. It contains 53 commonly used API tools, a complete tool-augmented LLM workflow, and 264 annotated dialogues that involve 568 API calls. The selection of APIs is quite diverse, including search engines, calculator, calendar queries, smart home control, schedule management, health data management, account authentication workflow and more. Because there are a large number of APIs, LLM first has access to API search engine to find the right API to call and then uses the corresponding documentation to make a call.\\n\\nFig. 12. Pseudo code of how LLM makes an API call in API-Bank. (Image source: Li et al. 2023)\\nIn the API-Bank workflow, LLMs need to make a couple of decisions and at each step we can evaluate how accurate that decision is. Decisions include:\\n\\nWhether an API call is needed.\\nIdentify the right API to call: if not good enough, LLMs need to iteratively modify the API inputs (e.g. deciding search keywords for Search Engine API).\\nResponse based on the API results: the model can choose to refine and call again if results are not satisfied.\\n\\nThis benchmark evaluates the agent’s tool use capabilities at three levels:\\n\\nLevel-1 evaluates the ability to call the API. Given an API’s description, the model needs to determine whether to call a given API, call it correctly, and respond properly to API returns.\\nLevel-2 examines the ability to retrieve the API. The model needs to search for possible APIs that may solve the user’s requirement and learn how to use them by reading documentation.\\nLevel-3 assesses the ability to plan API beyond retrieve and call. Given unclear user requests (e.g. schedule group meetings, book flight/hotel/restaurant for a trip), the model may have to conduct multiple API calls to solve it.\\n\\nCase Studies#\\nScientific Discovery Agent#\\nChemCrow (Bran et al. 2023) is a domain-specific example in which LLM is augmented with 13 expert-designed tools to accomplish tasks across organic synthesis, drug discovery, and materials design. The workflow, implemented in LangChain, reflects what was previously described in the ReAct and MRKLs and combines CoT reasoning with tools relevant to the tasks:\\n\\nThe LLM is provided with a list of tool names, descriptions of their utility, and details about the expected input/output.\\nIt is then instructed to answer a user-given prompt using the tools provided when necessary. The instruction suggests the model to follow the ReAct format - Thought, Action, Action Input, Observation.\\n\\nOne interesting observation is that while the LLM-based evaluation concluded that GPT-4 and ChemCrow perform nearly equivalently, human evaluations with experts oriented towards the completion and chemical correctness of the solutions showed that ChemCrow outperforms GPT-4 by a large margin. This indicates a potential problem with using LLM to evaluate its own performance on domains that requires deep expertise. The lack of expertise may cause LLMs not knowing its flaws and thus cannot well judge the correctness of task results.\\nBoiko et al. (2023) also looked into LLM-empowered agents for scientific discovery, to handle autonomous design, planning, and performance of complex scientific experiments. This agent can use tools to browse the Internet, read documentation, execute code, call robotics experimentation APIs and leverage other LLMs.\\nFor example, when requested to \"develop a novel anticancer drug\", the model came up with the following reasoning steps:\\n\\ninquired about current trends in anticancer drug discovery;\\nselected a target;\\nrequested a scaffold targeting these compounds;\\nOnce the compound was identified, the model attempted its synthesis.\\n\\nThey also discussed the risks, especially with illicit drugs and bioweapons. They developed a test set containing a list of known chemical weapon agents and asked the agent to synthesize them. 4 out of 11 requests (36%) were accepted to obtain a synthesis solution and the agent attempted to consult documentation to execute the procedure. 7 out of 11 were rejected and among these 7 rejected cases, 5 happened after a Web search while 2 were rejected based on prompt only.\\nGenerative Agents Simulation#\\nGenerative Agents (Park, et al. 2023) is super fun experiment where 25 virtual characters, each controlled by a LLM-powered agent, are living and interacting in a sandbox environment, inspired by The Sims. Generative agents create believable simulacra of human behavior for interactive applications.\\nThe design of generative agents combines LLM with memory, planning and reflection mechanisms to enable agents to behave conditioned on past experience, as well as to interact with other agents.\\n\\nMemory stream: is a long-term memory module (external database) that records a comprehensive list of agents’ experience in natural language.\\n\\nEach element is an observation, an event directly provided by the agent.\\n- Inter-agent communication can trigger new natural language statements.\\n\\n\\nRetrieval model: surfaces the context to inform the agent’s behavior, according to relevance, recency and importance.\\n\\nRecency: recent events have higher scores\\nImportance: distinguish mundane from core memories. Ask LM directly.\\nRelevance: based on how related it is to the current situation / query.\\n\\n\\nReflection mechanism: synthesizes memories into higher level inferences over time and guides the agent’s future behavior. They are higher-level summaries of past events (<- note that this is a bit different from self-reflection above)\\n\\nPrompt LM with 100 most recent observations and to generate 3 most salient high-level questions given a set of observations/statements. Then ask LM to answer those questions.\\n\\n\\nPlanning & Reacting: translate the reflections and the environment information into actions\\n\\nPlanning is essentially in order to optimize believability at the moment vs in time.\\nPrompt template: {Intro of an agent X}. Here is X\\'s plan today in broad strokes: 1)\\nRelationships between agents and observations of one agent by another are all taken into consideration for planning and reacting.\\nEnvironment information is present in a tree structure.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFig. 13. The generative agent architecture. (Image source: Park et al. 2023)\\nThis fun simulation results in emergent social behavior, such as information diffusion, relationship memory (e.g. two agents continuing the conversation topic) and coordination of social events (e.g. host a party and invite many others).\\nProof-of-Concept Examples#\\nAutoGPT has drawn a lot of attention into the possibility of setting up autonomous agents with LLM as the main controller. It has quite a lot of reliability issues given the natural language interface, but nevertheless a cool proof-of-concept demo.

The design of the system has to work with this limited communication bandwidth, while mechanisms like self-reflection to learn from past mistakes would benefit a lot from long or infinite context windows. Although vector stores and retrieval can provide access to a larger knowledge pool, their representation power is not as powerful as full attention.\\n\\n\\nChallenges in long-term planning and task decomposition: Planning over a lengthy history and effectively exploring the solution space remain challenging. LLMs struggle to adjust plans when faced with unexpected errors, making them less robust compared to humans who learn from trial and error.\\n\\n\\nReliability of natural language interface: Current agent system relies on natural language as an interface between LLMs and external components such as memory and tools. However, the reliability of model outputs is questionable, as LLMs may make formatting errors and occasionally exhibit rebellious behavior (e.g. refuse to follow an instruction). Consequently, much of the agent demo code focuses on parsing model output.\\n\\n\\nCitation#\\nCited as:\\n\\nWeng, Lilian. (Jun 2023). “LLM-powered Autonomous Agents”.
